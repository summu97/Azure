Passkey (FIDO2): Passkeys (FIDO2) in Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD) allow secure, passwordless login using biometrics (like fingerprint or facial recognition), PINs, or FIDO2-enabled security keys. Here's how it works:
--
* Instead of a password, a passkey uses a private key stored on your device and a public key stored in Azure.
* When signing in, you authenticate locally (via biometrics or PIN), and Azure validates your identity using the public key. 
* Uses Hardware-based keys for secure login.

Microsoft Authenticator: Microsoft will display a number to you and you need to authenticate using your mobile application.
--

SMS: You will get a one time password to your registered mobile number for authentication.
--

Temporary Access Pass: You will be given a temporary pass to login to your account and the pass will wont work after expiration time.

Software OATH token: A Software OATH Token is a time-based one-time password (TOTP) generator, typically implemented in software applications like Microsoft Authenticator, Google Authenticator, or other third-party apps. It is a popular method for implementing multi-factor authentication (MFA) in Azure environments.
--

Voice call: With this method, Azure sends a voice call to the user's registered phone number during the authentication process, and the user confirms their identity by interacting with the call.
--

Certificate-based authentication: Certificate-Based Authentication (CBA) in Azure provides a secure and robust method of verifying a user's or device's identity by using digital certificates. This method is commonly employed in high-security environments or where passwords or other authentication methods are considered less secure.
--

Email OTP: Email OTP (One-Time Password) in Azure is a method of providing a second layer of authentication for users by sending a one-time code to their registered email address. It is primarily used for scenarios where other multi-factor authentication (MFA) methods, like phone-based or app-based MFA, are not available or feasible.
--

Hardware OATH token: A Hardware OATH token in Azure is used as a part of multi-factor authentication (MFA) to enhance security. It provides a time-based one-time password (TOTP) that users enter during authentication, offering an additional layer of security beyond passwords.
