What is Azure API Management?
APIM is a secure middleman that protects, controls, and tracks access to your backend APIs.

🔹 Receives the request from the client or app
🔹 Checks for rules like:
    - Is the user allowed?
    - Is the request safe?
    - Has the user exceeded their limit?
🔹 Passes the request to the actual backend API
🔹 Returns the response back to the client



Q. Let’s say you have a web app that calls a backend API.
A. Instead of exposing the API directly, you send traffic through APIM, which:
  ✅ Checks if the request is allowed
  ✅ Logs it for analytics
  ✅ Sends it to your backend
  ✅ Returns the response to the user
